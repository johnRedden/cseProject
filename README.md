CSE Team Project - an interactive visualization based on data from API with predictive model.

Published Firebase App:  https://college-selection-tool.web.app/

To test code:
1. Copy the repo URL:  https://github.com/johnRedden/cseProject.git
2. Create a folder somewhere on your c-drive.
3. In visual studio code, open the folder.
4. Click on Terminal => New Terminal
5. In the terminal type: git clone https://github.com/johnRedden/cseProject.git
6. After clone is done, in VS Code Explorer, click on the cseProject folder.  You should see the index.html file in that folder.
7. In the terminal spin up a web server, type:  python -m http.server
8. Navigate to the local host it creates.  Mine is using port 8000: http://localhost:8000/

Give the api a minute to come in.  Open the developer tools to see progress on console.  You may have a CORS error, check in "Network" and resolve the error.
